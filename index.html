                                <p>I am a hardworking student hoping for internship experience in the following year. 
                                    I have a strong academic background with an overall GPA of 3.81 in high school 
                                    and 3.91 GPA in UCSD. Currently, my major GPA is 4.0. I am passionate for 
                                    computational research and projects. I have done two research projects in the past: one
                                    investigatesthe field of computational sustainability and the other one studies
                                    the transmission and storage of information.

                                    Meanwhile, I am currently working on two software projects. One is about building a
                                    Pomodoro timer in a group of nine. Another one is working in a CCC's project team to
                                    build a hosuing information website to help the current UCSD students. Both project's 
                                    prototypes will be finished around April, 2021.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My first programming language is Java. I have been using Java for programming since freshmen
                            year in high school. I have used Java for the study of OOP, data structures, and algorithms. At
                            my senior year in high school, I have also learned to use R language for machine learning. I made
                            models, graphs, and webpages using R.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Languages such as C, C++, Python are taught in UCSD for various purporses. Graphics and data structures
                            are the two main reasons I study and use these languages. I have started to study and use CSS, HTML, and 
                            JavaScript for web programming since the end of last year. As I have used these skills for many projects, 
                            I am more fluent in these languages. Besides the ones I mentioned above, I am also able to use tools 
                            such as Mathematica, Matlab and AutoCAD in a certain degress.
